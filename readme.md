# NewsNet

NewsNet is a set of tools designed to mine, process, and analyse the link network of global news sources.

## Background

NewsNet is comprised of three broad steps:

1. Collect URLs for news articles from the [GDELT FrontPage Graph database](https://blog.gdeltproject.org/announcing-gdelt-global-frontpage-graph-gfg/)
2. Download and parse HTML content from collected URLs
3. Produce a graph representation of the links between news sources
